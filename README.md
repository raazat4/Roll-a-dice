# Roll-a-dice
This is the best mini project for python programmer to start with. I have made it simple so that you can understand. Using #PYTHON it is much easier to play with code. You can copy it and add some other feature to give a drastic look. Thank You!


install python
add a path to environment variable
simply run it
like python (filename) on cmd
